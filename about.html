<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Rather a peaceful minded man who wanted nothing more than to live in the quiet places most people wouldn't even think or want since life is always expensive
  But I say differnet, It really depends on where in the world and it'll come once thingshave settled, time and patience is on
  everyone's side if used wisely

<p>Video Gamer (Yeah I know how "amazing" haha But some of the time I do tend to read because I need something to stimulate my mind
  instead of watching television eventhough cable television is so bland and useless(Why am I bothering to spend money on cable I'll never know)
  But video games alone has entranced me in to playing something new in life and give my parents a hard time (some of the time)
  But I'll admit video gaming isn't whta is used to be, SO Since i made a commitment to wanting to go back into the gaming ring 
  I decided I want to act upon bringing back classics to give the newer generation something to strive for.

<p>Wishing videro gaming was how it was many years ago where people came and enjoyed each others company as well as enjoy the absolute S&^T out of somehting that 
  brings smiles to them into knowing they played something worth while is a plus, while giving insight
  into how these games have brought many other companies to do the same into making their own as well for the public.
