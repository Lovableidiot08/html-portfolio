<h1>The Best Movies According to Algenis</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Transformers</h3>
<p>My thought process when this movie came out was a bit random because at the time I thought it was fake than realizing it was a childhood dream of watching this movie and finding out it passed all my expectations as a pre-teen at the time.</p>
<h3>Home Alone - Lost in New York</h3>
<p>I can only imagine a burgler coming into someones house and finding out many boobie-traps(haha get it XD) would be out of the question, than it goes on into producing amazing features of how to eleminitae your enemies in a more comedic "Child- friendly" sort of way.</p>
<h3>Death Race 2009</h3>
<p>One of the Very few films i Thoroughly enjoyed being many years into the future where the world has become so obselete that the prison system uses in-mates for entertainment and earning their freedom after winning five races.</p>
